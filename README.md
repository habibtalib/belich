# belich
Laravel admin dashboard totaly inspired by Nova, but with all the features and versatility that it does not have. 

The project is based on tailwindcss and jquery, eliminating Vuejs from the equation, since it impeded, from my point of view, the versatility of the project.

## Instalation

`composer require daguilarm/belich`

## Configuration 

`php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Daguilarm\Belich\BelichServiceProvider" --force`
